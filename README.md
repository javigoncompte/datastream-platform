# 🚀 DataStream Platform

# �� Databricks Bundles Deploy Monorepo
### Sync the una dependecy graph
```bash
uv run una sync
```
## 🔧 Prerequisites
1. **Install Databricks CLI 0.238 or later.**
   See [Install or update the Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/install.html).

2. **Install uv.** See [Installing uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
   We use uv to create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies.

3. **Authenticate to your Databricks workspace** if you have not done so already:
   ```bash
   $ databricks configure
   ```

4. **Optionally, install developer tools** such as the Databricks extension for Visual Studio Code from
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/vscode-ext.html. Or read the "getting started" documentation for
   **Databricks Connect** for instructions on running the included Python code from a different IDE.

5. **For documentation on the Databricks Asset Bundles format** used
   for this project, and for CI/CD configuration, see
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/index.html.

## 🚀 Deploy and run jobs

1. **Create a new virtual environment and install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   $ uv sync --all-packages
   ```

2. **To deploy a specific package/app bundle to the development target:**
   ```console
   $ databricks bundle deploy --target dev --var="type_of_deployment=packages" --var="deployment_name=datastream"
   ```

   > **Note:** "dev" is the default target, so the `--target` parameter is optional here.

   This deploys everything that's defined for this project.
   For example, the default template would deploy a job called
   `[dev yourname] datastream_job` to your workspace.
   You can find that job by opening your workspace and clicking on **Workflows**.

3. **Similarly, to deploy a production copy:**
   ```bash
   $ databricks bundle deploy --target prod --var="type_of_deployment=packages" --var="deployment_name=datastream"
   ```

4. **To run a job:**
   ```bash
   $ databricks bundle run
   ```

#  📚 MonoRepo Structure 

## 📁 Structure
- **�� libs**: importable packages, never run independently, do not have entry points
- **🌐 apps**: Applications that can be deployed to web servers, **never imported**
- **📦 packages**: Are just packages that you want to run either have entry points or just scripts calling custom packages **never imported**

## :ocean: Docker
You can use Docker or just normal wheel builds

## 🔄 Syncing
To make life easier while you're working across the workspace, you should run:
```bash
uv sync --all-packages
```

uv's sync behaviour is as follows:
- If you're in the workspace root and you run `uv sync`, it will sync only the
dependencies of the root workspace, which for this kind of monorepo should be bare.
This is not very useful.
- If you're in eg `apps/myserver` and run `uv sync`, it will sync only that package.
- You can run `uv sync --package=postmodern-server` to sync only that package.
- You can run `uv sync --all-packages` to sync all packages.

You can add an alias to your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` if you like:
```bash
alias uvs="uv sync --all-packages"
```

## 📋 Dependencies
You'll notice that `apps/mycli` has `urllib3` as a dependency.
Because of this, _every_ package in the workspace is able to import `urllib3` **in local development**,
even though they don't include it as a direct or transitive dependency.

This can make it possible to import stuff and write passing tests, only to have stuff fail
in production, where presumably you've only got the necessary dependencies installed.

There are two ways to guard against this:

1. **If you're working _only_ on eg `libs/server`**, you can sync only that package (see above).
This will make your LSP shout and your tests fail, if you try to import something that isn't
available to that package.

2. **Your CI** (see example in [.github/workflows](.github/workflows)) should do the same.

## Dev dependencies
This repo has all the global dev dependencies (`basedpyright`, `pytest`, `ruff` etc) in the root
pyproject.toml, and then repeated again in each package _without_ their version specifiers.

It's annoying to have to duplicate them, but at least excluding the versions makes it easier
to keep things in sync.

The reason they have to be repeated, is that if you follow the example above and install only
a specific package, it won't include anything specified in the root package.

## ⚡ Tasks/scripts

## 🧪 Testing
This repo includes a simple pytest test for each package.
```conosole
make fmt
make lint
make check
make test

make all
```
### Build
```bash
make build
```
## ✅ basedpyright
 >Note its a dev dependency so if you want to remove it and use ty or something else go ahead.

This repo actually uses [basedpyright](https://docs.basedpyright.com/latest/).

The following needs to be included with every package `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.basedpyright]
venvPath = "../.."       # point to the workspace root where the venv is
venv = ".venv"
strict = ["**/*.py"]
pythonVersion = "3.13"
```

Then you can run `uv run poe check` as for tests.

```bash
$ uvx --from build pyproject-build --installer=uv --outdir=dist --wheel apps/printer
```

## 🔨 Building Wheels
```bash
# Builds Evalgen a library
$ uvx --from build pyproject-build --installer=uv --outdir=dist  --wheel libs/evalgen

# Builds a package named datastream
$ uvx --with uvx-dynamic-versioning --from build pyproject-build --installer uv --wheel packages/datastream
```
